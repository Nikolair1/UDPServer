# UDPServer
This repository contains a C program (server.c) implementing a reliable UDP server using Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol for basic functionality. The server establishes a connection, handles data transfer, and tears down the connection. The code includes packet structures, printing functions, and socket setup.
